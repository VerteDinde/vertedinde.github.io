      <h2>Speaking</h2>
      <h4>I love public speaking.</h4>
      <p>I started my career in marketing and advertising, and developed the public speaking chops to excel in it. I've been
        speaking publicly and delivering presentations to executive teams for almost eight years, and have enjoyed every
        second of it.</p>
      <p>I have a strong educational background, both as an instructor and with curriculum development. I have experience covering
        beginning and advanced programming topics, among others. I love teaching workshops in addition to speaking, and am
        comfortable both with creating my own materials and teaching using an established deck.</p>
      <p>Interested? Email me! To see my previous talks, <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/keeleyhammond">view my Speaker Deck here.</a></p>

      <h2>Coffee & Mentorshop</h2>
      <p>This page was inspired by <a href="twitter.com/ellenchisa">@ellenchisa</a>, who wrote a great piece on mentorship.</p>
      <p>I like to meet new people, and I’ve been very fortunate through my career to have multiple people who have helped me along the way. As I’ve met new people and been exposed to new ideas, I’ve come to see networking and mentoring less as a stiff audition and more as a simple act of connecting with people.</p>
      <p>So let’s get coffee and chat! Or hey, if you don’t like coffee, let’s have breakfast together. Or go for a run in the morning. Or maybe grab a beer or glass of wine after work. But <a href="mailto:keeleymhammond@gmail.com">let’s meet and let’s talk</a>. I want to get to know you.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Agency work! Especially new takes on the field.</li>
        <li>New ideas and creative projects.</li>
        <li>Education and classes</li>
        <li>Stop-motion animation and sound design.</li>
        <li>Hiking and backpacking in Oregon</li>
        <li>Reading – currently I’m reading Originals: How Non-Conformists Move the World by Adam M. Grant.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Want to do coffee? Send me an email including some of the things you’d like to talk about! We don’t have to stick to the script, but I’d love to know what’s on your mind. If you’re looking for help getting into the agency business or working at Think Shift, email me. I’ll happily prepare for any specific questions you have, or prepare a mock interview.</p>
      <p>I'm also very active on Twitter, the WIT Slack and LinkedIn; you can find me there.</p>
